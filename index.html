I think raccoons are really cute. I really like their color palette, their eye masks, and stripes. I can't say much for areas where they are massive pests but in my experience they are very silly playful creatures. I follow a lot of raccoon shelters on social media and enjoy watching the raccoons hashtag on instagram. I like how raccons can live in different places like forests and big cities. I also think its funny how huge they can get to the point where they're just big round fur balls.
